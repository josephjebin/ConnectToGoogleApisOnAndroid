This repo shows how to log in and connect to Google Apis. This app pulls data from the user's Google Calendar, but the logic can be applied to any Google Api. 

How to Run Locally 
1. Create an Android OAuth client in the Google Developer Console, and put the credentials.json in the app directory. 
2. Enable the Google Calendar Api for the project.
3. Run the app and follow the log in and authorization flows.
